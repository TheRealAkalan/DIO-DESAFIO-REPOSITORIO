somebody save me

I feel my wings
Have broken in your hands
I feel the words unspoken inside
When they pull you under
And I will give you anything you want, oh
You were all I wanted
And all my dreams are fallen down
Crawlin' around
Somebody save me
Let your warm hands break right through
Somebody save me - smallville
I don't care how you do it, just stay, stay
C'mon, I've been waiting for you
I see the world has folded in your heart
I feel the waves crash down inside
And they pull me under
And I would give you anything you want, oh
You were all I wanted
And all my dreams have fallen down
Crawlin' around
Somebody save me
Let your warm hands break right through
Somebody save me
I don't care how you do it, just stay, stay
C'mon, I've been waiting for you
Crawlin' around
Somebody save me
Let your warm hands break right through
Somebody save me
I don't care how you do it, just stay (Stay with me)
I made this whole world shine for you
Just stay, stay
C'mon, I'm still waiting for you
